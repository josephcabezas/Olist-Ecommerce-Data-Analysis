# Project Background
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Olist, a major Brazilian e-commerce platform, connects small businesses and sellers with larger online marketplaces across Brazil. They are often called the Amazon of Latin America. As Olist scales, it faces operational challenges, particularly in optimizing order fulfillment, customer satisfaction, and vendor performance. These challenges arise from the complex dynamics of order statuses, payment methods, freight logistics, and regional customer preferences.

This project conducts a focused SQL-based analysis on a dataset of 99,441 orders from March 2016 to August 2018, using relational database queries to extract key insights. The database schema can viewed below. Key areas of analysis include order completion rates, payment trends, freight efficiency, geographic purchasing patterns, and customer review sentiment. It is important to note that this is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced to preserve security.

By analyzing Olistâ€™s e-commerce and customer data, this project aims to uncover meaningful trends and insights across areas such as order behavior, payment methods, and customer satisfaction. The findings will provide Olist with a clearer understanding of marketplace dynamics, operational challenges, and customer preferences, helping the company identify opportunities for operational improvements and profitable growth.
